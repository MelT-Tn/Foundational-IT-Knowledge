        -
          
### 2. **Resources Used**
      -
  
### 3. **Challenges and Questions**
   - **Challenge 1**: Struggled to fully understand the difference between Layer 3 and Layer 4 functions.
   - **Questions**: How does the OSI model apply to real-world network troubleshooting?

### 4. **Practical Exercises**
   - **Exercise 1**: Set up a simple network using VirtualBox and tested connectivity between virtual machines.
     - **Outcome**: Successfully configured the network, but ran into issues with DHCP settings. Need to revisit this tomorrow.

### 5. **Reflection**
   - **What Went Well**: Iâ€™m getting more comfortable with Linux commands, and the OSI model makes more sense now.
   - **What Could Be Improved**: Need to spend more time on practical applications of networking concepts.

### 6. **Goals for Tomorrow**
   - **Goal 1**: Revisit DHCP configuration and understand its role in network communication.
   - **Goal 2**: Start learning about basic cybersecurity concepts, specifically firewalls and their configurations.
